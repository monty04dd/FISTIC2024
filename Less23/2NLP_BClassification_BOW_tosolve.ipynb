, and i guarantee you that nothing else this year will even come close . \\\\nin fact , i\\\\'ll be surprised if i see anything this bad in the next ten years . \\\\nbased on the novel by scientology guru l . ron hubbard , battlefield earth begins and we immediately find out two pieces of key information . \\\\nit\\\\'s the year 3000 , and an alien race called the psychlos ( which sounds like a tag team of mexican wrestlers ) conquered our planet in nine minutes . \\\\nok , we are all of 10 seconds in and i have a zillion questions racing through my mind . \\\\nwhen were we conquered ? \\\\nthe audience is led to believe that this happened about 1 , 000 years earlier , and if that is the case then we\\\\'re going to get into a whole bunch of problems later ( trust me . . . \\\\nkeep reading ) . \\\\nalso , why don\\\\'t we get to see earth get conquered ? \\\\nhow the hell do you make a popcorn sci-fi flick and not deliver the goods on the one event that sets up the film ? \\\\nhumans now live as cavemen or slave labor , and for the film\\\\'s first act we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of denver , colorado . \\\\nthey grunt and groan and babble about monsters . \\\\nso , when the psychlos conquered earth , were the only humans not captured a herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills ? \\\\nnone of these characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered ( whenever that was ) . \\\\nthis is definitely not the way to start an action/sci-fi film . \\\\none of the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across what he thinks is a monster , and he begins to fight it . \\\\nthe \\\" monster \\\" turns out to be a dinosaur from an old miniature golf course . \\\\nhe turns around and sees all sorts of other characters from the golf course , with some shrubs growing over them . \\\\nso , in 1 , 000 years this stupid little golf course has stood the test of time , with only a few weeds growing over it ? \\\\nanyway , some of the humans are captured by the psychlos led by terl ( john travolta ) a smarmy and opportunistic alien planning on stealing a recently discovered gold deposit . \\\\nthe cavemen ( led by barry pepper ) are forced to do their bidding or whatever , but eventually they gain the upper hand and reclaim the planet , or something . \\\\nso these cavemen are able to do what earth failed to do 1 , 000 years earlier ? \\\\nand , we\\\\'re supposed to believe that earth was conquered in nine minutes by a group of buffoonish aliens who can\\\\'t even handle a few cavemen ? \\\\none of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of abandoned air force jets and using them to fight the psychlos . \\\\nso jets left unattended for 1 , 000 years are still able to fly ? \\\\nplease , if i leave my car unattended for two weeks i have to replace every fluid and hose under the hood . \\\\nwhy did the psychlos leave jets around anyway ? \\\\nshouldn\\\\'t they have destroyed military installations during their massive nine minute campaign against us ? \\\\nthe psychlos refer to humans as \\\" man animals \\\" but yet dogs are still \\\" dogs \\\" . \\\\nwhy aren\\\\'t they \\\" dog animals \\\" ? \\\\nthe psychlos are after mining earth\\\\'s precious resources , but for 1 , 000 years are unaware of fort knox ? \\\\nwhy do i even care at this point ? \\\\ni\\\\'m a fan of travolta\\\\'s and i\\\\'m glad to see he\\\\'s back on the a-list in hollywood ( despite the fact that he occasionally puts out crowd pleasing dreck like michael and phenomenon ) . \\\\nbut how did he possibly think this was a good movie ? \\\\nand how did he think he was giving a good performance here ? \\\\nhe\\\\'s more than capable of making a menacing villain ( see broken arrow and face/off ) but whenever his character came on screen i couldn\\\\'t hold back my laughter . \\\\nnow despite the different facial features members of this alien race seem to have , travolta just looks like travolta . \\\\nall of the other aliens have weird foreheads or other pointy bones on their face , but travolta just has a goatee . \\\\nalso , travolta\\\\'s acts with a sort of phony upper-class snooty accent and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsense back on his home world . \\\\nooooo , scary villain . \\\\nas a producer he should know better and as an actor he should definitely know better . \\\\nyou can make a dumb but good sci-fi film ( i love independence day for example ) , but there is absolutely nothing entertaining about battlefield earth . \\\\ni did everything i possibly could to stay awake during the screening . . . \\\\ni cleaned my glasses , walked around the theater , made a grocery list , chose my lottery numbers for the week , replayed super bowl xxv in my head ( with commercials ) . . . \\\\nand still was compelled to scrutinize the insides of my eyelids . \\\\nby the time we actually reach the year 3000 , people should still be avoiding this film . \\\\nfolks , save your cash . . \\\\ndon\\\\'t go see it , don\\\\'t rent it , and don\\\\'t buy it . \\\\nyou\\\\'d be more entertained by taking the money you\\\\'d use for this movie and just throwing it into the wind , watching it sail away ( hell , send it to us here at the jacksonville film journal . . . \\\\nwe\\\\'ll entertain you plenty with that kind of money ) . \\\\nunless of course you\\\\'re just captivated by countless slow motion shots of barry pepper running , which is just about all you\\\\'ll come away with from this movie . \\\\nthat , and a headache . \\\\n[editor\\\\'s note : for some reason though , the day after my screening i converted to scientology . \\\\ni\\\\'m not sure why . . . \\\\nsomething just made me feel compelled make the choice . ] \\\\n'\",\n          \"b'usually when a blockbuster comes out , it\\\\'s loaded with effects , stars , bad scripts , and plenty of action . \\\\nmystery men may contain an all-star cast , and efects , but the clever script and characters are what really works , which is rare to see this year . \\\\nthe film is based upon the comic book series \\\" the flaming carrot \\\" by bob burden , in which 3 wanna be super heroes try and fight crime , only to be out done by the real hero of champion city , captain amazing ( greg kinnear ) . \\\\nthings go a little haywire , when the sinister casanova frankenstein ( geoffrey rush ) is released into the city , where he captures captain amazing , and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city . \\\\nwell , the trio decide to take matters in their own hands , by saving the city , but first they need some assitance . \\\\nthis is where the film takes a turn for the better . \\\\nin the beggining , there were only 3 wanna be heroes . \\\\n \\\" blue raja ( hank azaria ) , \\\" mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and \\\" the shoveller ( william h . macy ) . \\\\nsure they were enterataining , but their acts grew old fast . \\\\nthat is until they aquire \\\" invisible boy \\\" ( kel mitchell ) , and \\\" the bowler \\\" ( janeane garafalo ) and \\\" mr . splein \\\" ( paul reubens ) , 2 of which rescue the film from becoming a disastorous mess . \\\\nthankfully , the original 3 heroes become amusing , with some support of reuben and garfalo on screen . \\\\nthe whole premise is rather ridiculous , but packs a few punches to keep interest . \\\\nfor one , the film is considerably clever . \\\\nit literally pokes fun at super hero films , like batman and robin , superman etc . in fact , many scenes are similar to batman and robin , including the opening sequence , only altered in a humorous and superior way . \\\\na part of the cleverness comes from the cast . \\\\nsometimes a film with such talent is overblown , but the acting is what keeps it alive here . \\\\nwhile azaria and macy were enteratining , 2 characters really stood out . \\\\none was paul reuben . \\\\nno matter how disgusting or revolting \\\" mr . splein \\\" may be , you still can\\\\'t help but laugh . \\\\nit\\\\' so incredibly moronic , it\\\\'s just a riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions . \\\\njaneane garafalo also was an interesting character . \\\\nshe seemed to be the most outgoing and convincing character on screem , due to her enthusiasm , that kept the film flowing . \\\\nmen is worth seeing alone , for those 2 troubled heroes . \\\\non the downside , a few of the heroes and especially the villain never really lift off . \\\\nkel mitchell and geoffrey rush , were both utterly useless . \\\\ntheir parts were so limited , they\\\\'d be lucky at all to be on screen for more than 20 minutes . \\\\nben stiller too was wasted , mostly because of his unlikeable power and dialogue . \\\\nnone of these characters get a rise out of anybody , but happily they are lost in the charming flow of the film . \\\\nas far as the budget goes , it was wisely spent on the cast , not the effects . \\\\nwhile the set designs and action all look nice , i\\\\'m glad there was a seperate aspect , that the film focused on , and for that i applaud . \\\\nslow at times , and rather pointless , mystery men still delivers . \\\\nit forgets about money making , because it\\\\'s not likely to make a bundle like it\\\\'s proceeders , and that\\\\'s what works . \\\\nstupid ? \\\\nmaybe , but for once i\\\\'m not disappointed . \\\\nno one expected an intelligent film , but you get a film thats wit captures your attention and makes you forget this miserable year . \\\\n'\",\n          \"b'if i were one of those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact on the success or failure of certain films , i might say that i review movies that don\\\\'t look particularly good because i\\\\'m doing a service to my readers by warning them against seeing it . \\\\nif that were true , i could put a banner at the top of my site that reads : \\\" shay casey : seeing bad movies so you don\\\\'t have to . \\\" \\\\nbut i know that\\\\'s bunk-you\\\\'re going to see whatever movies you want to no matter what i say . \\\\nso i have to tell the truth : every once in a while i get a nasty , masochistic urge to see a bad movie . \\\\nyou know the feeling , when you\\\\'re sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want to see something you can have a ball trashing mercilessly . \\\\nsometimes i think that\\\\'s why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies , ever . \\\\nadmit it : sometimes you like seeing bad movies . \\\\nso do i . \\\\nso i saw \\\" supernova . \\\" \\\\ntruth be told , \\\" supernova \\\" wasn\\\\'t quite as bad as i thought it might be . \\\\nmaybe i just felt sorry for the actors , or maybe i thought it could have been decent if the studio hadn\\\\'t started tinkering with the director\\\\'s ( walter hill ) final cut , causing him to want his name removed . \\\\nmaybe i\\\\'m becoming a softy . \\\\nin any case , i didn\\\\'t find \\\" supernova \\\" as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe . \\\\nbut it\\\\'s still bad . \\\\nthe film takes place aboard the medical space vessel \\\" nightingale . \\\" \\\\nthe crew includes captain a . j . \\\\nmarley ( robert forster ) , his new second officer nick vanzant ( james spader ) , head medical officer kaela evers ( angela bassett ) , medical technicians yerzy penalosa ( lou diamond phillips ) and danika lund ( robin tunney ) , and computer technician benj sotomejor ( wilson cruz ) . \\\\nthere are some attempts at \\\" characterization , \\\" but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction , which puts kaela on edge , yerzy and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissy-faces at each other every five minutes , and benj ( apparently gay ) is in love with the computer ( apparently female ) . \\\\ndon\\\\'t expect any more explanation , because you won\\\\'t get it . \\\\nanyway , the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent . \\\\nduring the dimension jump ( i think that\\\\'s what it\\\\'s called , but don\\\\'t hold me to it ) , the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal ( peter facinelli ) is brought on board . \\\\nhe calls himself troy larson , making him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with . \\\\nthen a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening . \\\\nhave you seen \\\" alien ? \\\" \\\\nhave you seen \\\" event horizon \\\" ( a lame movie in its own right ) ? \\\\ngood . \\\\nthen you\\\\'ve seen \\\" supernova . \\\" \\\\npost-production cuts or not , there is nothing original about this screenplay , and nothing unpredictable either . \\\\nafter all , no one\\\\'s going to think for a second that troy won\\\\'t turn out to be a villain . \\\\nbut the bigger problem with \\\" supernova \\\" is that it can\\\\' t just stick to the simple plot it\\\\'s afforded . \\\\nnumerous re-writes ( the script may be credited to three people , but it\\\\'s a gross underestimate ) have crammed this lean 90-minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped . \\\\nwas there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot ? \\\\ndid the ship\\\\'s computer learn something about humanity ? \\\\nwhat was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him ? \\\\nand just what does the film\\\\'s title signify , if anything ? \\\\nas far as i can tell , it refers to a very small plot detail that isn\\\\'t developed , just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements . \\\\ncharacter relationships in this film also make very little sense . \\\\nfor some reason , every person in this film keeps having sex . \\\\nwe get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes . \\\\nbassett and spader\\\\'s characters start off hating each other . \\\\nfifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later , they\\\\'re engaging in some hanky-panky . \\\\nwhen troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship , of course both female crew members will fall in love with him . \\\\nevery single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly , which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut . \\\\nthe most prominent example , however , may be the fact that when the film starts , there are no opening credits ! \\\\nfurthermore , the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits . \\\\nmaybe that\\\\'s why the film\\\\'s title is mentioned twice during the end credits , right between james spader and robert forster . \\\\nright after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you\\\\'re seeing ( lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery ) , you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene , with little-to-no introduction to any of the characters or situations . \\\\nthe rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes ( you know , where they explain things ) and just went from point a to point b . point a : danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby . \\\\npoint b : tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing . \\\\ndoesn\\\\'t make sense . \\\\nsince i didn\\\\'t understand anything about these characters\\\\' motivations , did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one-by-one ( and he does , knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes ) ? \\\\nnot a whit . \\\\nit\\\\'s a shame , because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do . \\\\nthey don\\\\'t find it . \\\\nbassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces . \\\\nsexual tension ? \\\\nmore like constipation . \\\\nmaybe they\\\\'re just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as \\\" this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and a whole lot less nice . \\\" \\\\nnot that we ever find out who that is , mind you . \\\\nthe climax of their relationship ( taking place in a transport pod ) is probably the film\\\\'s biggest forehead-slapper . \\\\nas troy , peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected . \\\\nhe\\\\' s awfully one-note , but it\\\\'s not as if he\\\\'s given any more notes to work with . \\\\nthe rest of the cast does even less . \\\\ntunney stands around looking cute , then scared . \\\\nphillips broods . \\\\ncruz flirts with the computer . \\\\nthen they all die and a star blows up or something , but i really wasn\\\\'t paying much attention by then . \\\\n \\\" supernova \\\" is pretty awful , but i\\\\'m cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got . \\\\nthat\\\\'s it . \\\\nif you expect it to be good ( for whatever reasons you may have ) , you\\\\'ll probably hate it more than i will . \\\\neven the special effects are fairly unimpressive , nothing you haven\\\\' t seen before , and suffice to say the script isn\\\\'t going to save the film . \\\\nhonestly , though , what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym ? \\\\nit usually results in a bad movie , and that\\\\'s what \\\" supernova \\\" is . \\\\n'\"\n

and i guarantee you that nothing else this year will even come close . \\nin fact , i'll be surprised if i see anything this bad in the next ten years . \\nbased on the novel by scientology guru l . ron hubbard , battlefield earth begins and we immediately find out two pieces of key information . \\nit's the year 3000 , and an alien race called the psychlos ( which sounds like a tag team of mexican wrestlers ) conquered our planet in nine minutes . \\nok , we are all of 10 seconds in and i have a zillion questions racing through my mind . \\nwhen were we conquered ? \\nthe audience is led to believe that this happened about 1 , 000 years earlier , and if that is the case then we're going to get into a whole bunch of problems later ( trust me . . . \\nkeep reading ) . \\nalso , why don't we get to see earth get conquered ? \\nhow the hell do you make a popcorn sci-fi flick and not deliver the goods on the one event that sets up the film ? \\nhumans now live as cavemen or slave labor , and for the film's first act we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of denver , colorado . \\nthey grunt and groan and babble about monsters . \\nso , when the psychlos conquered earth , were the only humans not captured a herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills ? \\nnone of these characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered ( whenever that was ) . \\nthis is definitely not the way to start an action/sci-fi film . \\none of the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across what he thinks is a monster , and he begins to fight it . \\nthe \\\" monster \\\" turns out to be a dinosaur from an old miniature golf course . \\nhe turns around and sees all sorts of other characters from the golf course , with some shrubs growing over them . \\nso , in 1 , 000 years this stupid little golf course has stood the test of time , with only a few weeds growing over it ? \\nanyway , some of the humans are captured by the psychlos led by terl ( john travolta ) a smarmy and opportunistic alien planning on stealing a recently discovered gold deposit . \\nthe cavemen ( led by barry pepper ) are forced to do their bidding or whatever , but eventually they gain the upper hand and reclaim the planet , or something . \\nso these cavemen are able to do what earth failed to do 1 , 000 years earlier ? \\nand , we're supposed to believe that earth was conquered in nine minutes by a group of buffoonish aliens who can't even handle a few cavemen ? \\none of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of abandoned air force jets and using them to fight the psychlos . \\nso jets left unattended for 1 , 000 years are still able to fly ? \\nplease , if i leave my car unattended for two weeks i have to replace every fluid and hose under the hood . \\nwhy did the psychlos leave jets around anyway ? \\nshouldn't they have destroyed military installations during their massive nine minute campaign against us ? \\nthe psychlos refer to humans as \\\" man animals \\\" but yet dogs are still \\\" dogs \\\" . \\nwhy aren't they \\\" dog animals \\\" ? \\nthe psychlos are after mining earth's precious resources , but for 1 , 000 years are unaware of fort knox ? \\nwhy do i even care at this point ? \\ni'm a fan of travolta's and i'm glad to see he's back on the a-list in hollywood ( despite the fact that he occasionally puts out crowd pleasing dreck like michael and phenomenon ) . \\nbut how did he possibly think this was a good movie ? \\nand how did he think he was giving a good performance here ? \\nhe's more than capable of making a menacing villain ( see broken arrow and face/off ) but whenever his character came on screen i couldn't hold back my laughter . \\nnow despite the different facial features members of this alien race seem to have , travolta just looks like travolta . \\nall of the other aliens have weird foreheads or other pointy bones on their face , but travolta just has a goatee . \\nalso , travolta's acts with a sort of phony upper-class snooty accent and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsense back on his home world . \\nooooo , scary villain . \\nas a producer he should know better and as an actor he should definitely know better . \\nyou can make a dumb but good sci-fi film ( i love independence day for example ) , but there is absolutely nothing entertaining about battlefield earth . \\ni did everything i possibly could to stay awake during the screening . . . \\ni cleaned my glasses , walked around the theater , made a grocery list , chose my lottery numbers for the week , replayed super bowl xxv in my head ( with commercials ) . . . \\nand still was compelled to scrutinize the insides of my eyelids . \\nby the time we actually reach the year 3000 , people should still be avoiding this film . \\nfolks , save your cash . . \\ndon't go see it , don't rent it , and don't buy it . \\nyou'd be more entertained by taking the money you'd use for this movie and just throwing it into the wind , watching it sail away ( hell , send it to us here at the jacksonville film journal . . . \\nwe'll entertain you plenty with that kind of money ) . \\nunless of course you're just captivated by countless slow motion shots of barry pepper running , which is just about all you'll come away with from this movie . \\nthat , and a headache . \\n[editor's note : for some reason though , the day after my screening i converted to scientology . \\ni'm not sure why . . . \\nsomething just made me feel compelled make the choice . ] \\n\",\n          \"usually when a blockbuster comes out , it's loaded with effects , stars , bad scripts , and plenty of action . \\nmystery men may contain an all-star cast , and efects , but the clever script and characters are what really works , which is rare to see this year . \\nthe film is based upon the comic book series \\\" the flaming carrot \\\" by bob burden , in which 3 wanna be super heroes try and fight crime , only to be out done by the real hero of champion city , captain amazing ( greg kinnear ) . \\nthings go a little haywire , when the sinister casanova frankenstein ( geoffrey rush ) is released into the city , where he captures captain amazing , and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city . \\nwell , the trio decide to take matters in their own hands , by saving the city , but first they need some assitance . \\nthis is where the film takes a turn for the better . \\nin the beggining , there were only 3 wanna be heroes . \\n \\\" blue raja ( hank azaria ) , \\\" mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and \\\" the shoveller ( william h . macy ) . \\nsure they were enterataining , but their acts grew old fast . \\nthat is until they aquire \\\" invisible boy \\\" ( kel mitchell ) , and \\\" the bowler \\\" ( janeane garafalo ) and \\\" mr . splein \\\" ( paul reubens ) , 2 of which rescue the film from becoming a disastorous mess . \\nthankfully , the original 3 heroes become amusing , with some support of reuben and garfalo on screen . \\nthe whole premise is rather ridiculous , but packs a few punches to keep interest . \\nfor one , the film is considerably clever . \\nit literally pokes fun at super hero films , like batman and robin , superman etc . in fact , many scenes are similar to batman and robin , including the opening sequence , only altered in a humorous and superior way . \\na part of the cleverness comes from the cast . \\nsometimes a film with such talent is overblown , but the acting is what keeps it alive here . \\nwhile azaria and macy were enteratining , 2 characters really stood out . \\none was paul reuben . \\nno matter how disgusting or revolting \\\" mr . splein \\\" may be , you still can't help but laugh . \\nit' so incredibly moronic , it's just a riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions . \\njaneane garafalo also was an interesting character . \\nshe seemed to be the most outgoing and convincing character on screem , due to her enthusiasm , that kept the film flowing . \\nmen is worth seeing alone , for those 2 troubled heroes . \\non the downside , a few of the heroes and especially the villain never really lift off . \\nkel mitchell and geoffrey rush , were both utterly useless . \\ntheir parts were so limited , they'd be lucky at all to be on screen for more than 20 minutes . \\nben stiller too was wasted , mostly because of his unlikeable power and dialogue . \\nnone of these characters get a rise out of anybody , but happily they are lost in the charming flow of the film . \\nas far as the budget goes , it was wisely spent on the cast , not the effects . \\nwhile the set designs and action all look nice , i'm glad there was a seperate aspect , that the film focused on , and for that i applaud . \\nslow at times , and rather pointless , mystery men still delivers . \\nit forgets about money making , because it's not likely to make a bundle like it's proceeders , and that's what works . \\nstupid ? \\nmaybe , but for once i'm not disappointed . \\nno one expected an intelligent film , but you get a film thats wit captures your attention and makes you forget this miserable year . \\n\",\n          \"if i were one of those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact on the success or failure of certain films , i might say that i review movies that don't look particularly good because i'm doing a service to my readers by warning them against seeing it . \\nif that were true , i could put a banner at the top of my site that reads : \\\" shay casey : seeing bad movies so you don't have to . \\\" \\nbut i know that's bunk-you're going to see whatever movies you want to no matter what i say . \\nso i have to tell the truth : every once in a while i get a nasty , masochistic urge to see a bad movie . \\nyou know the feeling , when you're sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want to see something you can have a ball trashing mercilessly . \\nsometimes i think that's why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies , ever . \\nadmit it : sometimes you like seeing bad movies . \\nso do i . \\nso i saw \\\" supernova . \\\" \\ntruth be told , \\\" supernova \\\" wasn't quite as bad as i thought it might be . \\nmaybe i just felt sorry for the actors , or maybe i thought it could have been decent if the studio hadn't started tinkering with the director's ( walter hill ) final cut , causing him to want his name removed . \\nmaybe i'm becoming a softy . \\nin any case , i didn't find \\\" supernova \\\" as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe . \\nbut it's still bad . \\nthe film takes place aboard the medical space vessel \\\" nightingale . \\\" \\nthe crew includes captain a . j . \\nmarley ( robert forster ) , his new second officer nick vanzant ( james spader ) , head medical officer kaela evers ( angela bassett ) , medical technicians yerzy penalosa ( lou diamond phillips ) and danika lund ( robin tunney ) , and computer technician benj sotomejor ( wilson cruz ) . \\nthere are some attempts at \\\" characterization , \\\" but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction , which puts kaela on edge , yerzy and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissy-faces at each other every five minutes , and benj ( apparently gay ) is in love with the computer ( apparently female ) . \\ndon't expect any more explanation , because you won't get it . \\nanyway , the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent . \\nduring the dimension jump ( i think that's what it's called , but don't hold me to it ) , the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal ( peter facinelli ) is brought on board . \\nhe calls himself troy larson , making him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with . \\nthen a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening . \\nhave you seen \\\" alien ? \\\" \\nhave you seen \\\" event horizon \\\" ( a lame movie in its own right ) ? \\ngood . \\nthen you've seen \\\" supernova . \\\" \\npost-production cuts or not , there is nothing original about this screenplay , and nothing unpredictable either . \\nafter all , no one's going to think for a second that troy won't turn out to be a villain . \\nbut the bigger problem with \\\" supernova \\\" is that it can' t just stick to the simple plot it's afforded . \\nnumerous re-writes ( the script may be credited to three people , but it's a gross underestimate ) have crammed this lean 90-minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped . \\nwas there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot ? \\ndid the ship's computer learn something about humanity ? \\nwhat was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him ? \\nand just what does the film's title signify , if anything ? \\nas far as i can tell , it refers to a very small plot detail that isn't developed , just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements . \\ncharacter relationships in this film also make very little sense . \\nfor some reason , every person in this film keeps having sex . \\nwe get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes . \\nbassett and spader's characters start off hating each other . \\nfifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later , they're engaging in some hanky-panky . \\nwhen troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship , of course both female crew members will fall in love with him . \\nevery single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly , which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut . \\nthe most prominent example , however , may be the fact that when the film starts , there are no opening credits ! \\nfurthermore , the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits . \\nmaybe that's why the film's title is mentioned twice during the end credits , right between james spader and robert forster . \\nright after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you're seeing ( lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery ) , you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene , with little-to-no introduction to any of the characters or situations . \\nthe rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes ( you know , where they explain things ) and just went from point a to point b . point a : danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby . \\npoint b : tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing . \\ndoesn't make sense . \\nsince i didn't understand anything about these characters' motivations , did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one-by-one ( and he does , knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes ) ? \\nnot a whit . \\nit's a shame , because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do . \\nthey don't find it . \\nbassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces . \\nsexual tension ? \\nmore like constipation . \\nmaybe they're just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as \\\" this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and a whole lot less nice . \\\" \\nnot that we ever find out who that is , mind you . \\nthe climax of their relationship ( taking place in a transport pod ) is probably the film's biggest forehead-slapper . \\nas troy , peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected . \\nhe' s awfully one-note , but it's not as if he's given any more notes to work with . \\nthe rest of the cast does even less . \\ntunney stands around looking cute , then scared . \\nphillips broods . \\ncruz flirts with the computer . \\nthen they all die and a star blows up or something , but i really wasn't paying much attention by then . \\n \\\" supernova \\\" is pretty awful , but i'm cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got . \\nthat's it . \\nif you expect it to be good ( for whatever reasons you may have ) , you'll probably hate it more than i will . \\neven the special effects are fairly unimpressive , nothing you haven' t seen before , and suffice to say the script isn't going to save the film . \\nhonestly , though , what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym ? \\nit usually results in a bad movie , and that's what \\\" supernova \\\" is . \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

sets  the film  humans now live  cavemen  slave labor  and for the films first act  focus  one particular cavemen group outside  denver  colorado  they grunt and groan and babble about monsters    when the psychlos conquered earth  were the only humans not captured  herd  newborn babies that crawled their way  safety  the hills  none  these characters have any knowledge  the planet being conquered  whenever that was   this  definitely not the way  start  actionscifi film  one  the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across what  thinks   monster  and  begins  fight   the  monster  turns out    dinosaur from  old miniature golf course   turns around and sees all sorts  other characters from the golf course  with some shrubs growing over them        years this

minute campaign against   the psychlos refer  humans   man animals  but yet dogs are still  dogs   why not they  dog animals   the psychlos are after mining earths precious resources  but for    years

phenomenon   but how did  possibly think this was  good movie  and how did  think  was giving  good performance here  hes more than capable  making  menacing villain  see broken arrow and faceoff  but whenever his character came  screen  not hold back  laughter  now despite the different facial features members  this alien race seem  have  travolta just looks like travolta  all  the other aliens have weird foreheads  other pointy bones  their face  but travolta just has  goatee  also  travoltas acts with  sort  phony upperclass snooty accent and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsense back  his home world  ooooo  scary villain    producer  should know better and   actor  should definitely know better  you can make  dumb but good scifi film   love independence day for example   but there  absolutely nothing entertaining about battlefield earth   did everything  possibly could  stay awake during the screening     cleaned  glasses  walked around the theater  made  grocery list  chose  lottery numbers for the week  replayed super bowl xxv   head  with commercials     and still was compelled  scrutinize the insides   eyelids   the time  actually reach the year   people should still  avoiding this film  folks  save your cash   not  see   not rent   and not buy   youd  more entertained  taking the money youd use for this movie and just throwing  into the wind  watching  sail away  hell  send    here  the jacksonville film journal    well entertain you plenty with that kind  money   unless  course youre just captivated  countless slow motion shots  barry pepper running  which  just about all youll come away with from this movie  that  and  headache  editors note  for some reason though  the day after  screening  converted  scientology   not sure why    something just made  feel compelled make the choice   \",\n          \"usually when  blockbuster comes out  its loaded with effects  stars  bad scripts  and plenty  action  mystery men may contain  allstar cast  and efects  but the clever script and characters are what really works  which  rare  see this year  the film  based upon the comic book series  the flaming carrot   bob burden   which  wanna  super heroes try and fight crime  only   out done  the real hero  champion city  captain amazing  greg kinnear   things   little haywire  when the sinister casanova frankenstein  geoffrey rush   released into the city  where  captures captain amazing  and plans  wreak havoc upon champion city  well  the trio decide  take matters  their own hands   saving the city  but first they need some assitance  this  where the film takes  turn for the better   the beggining  there were only  wanna  heroes   blue raja  hank azaria      furious  ben stiller  and  the shoveller  william   macy   sure they were enterataining  but their acts grew old fast  that  until they aquire  invisible boy   kel mitchell   and  the bowler   janeane garafalo  and    splein   paul reubens     which rescue the film from becoming  disastorous mess  thankfully  the original  heroes become amusing  with some support  reuben and garfalo  screen  the whole premise  rather ridiculous  but packs  few punches  keep interest  for one  the film  considerably clever   literally pokes fun  super hero films  like batman and robin  superman etc   fact  many scenes are similar  batman and robin  including the opening sequence  only altered   humorous and superior way   part  the cleverness comes from the cast  sometimes  film with such talent  overblown  but the acting  what keeps  alive here  while azaria and macy were enteratining   characters really stood out  one was paul reuben   matter how disgusting  revolting    splein  may   you still not help but laugh    incredibly moronic  its just  riot watching reuben relieve himself  bodily functions  janeane garafalo also was  interesting character  she seemed   the most outgoing and convincing character  screem  due  her enthusiasm  that kept the film flowing  men  worth seeing alone  for those  troubled heroes   the downside   few  the heroes and especially the villain never really lift off  kel mitchell and geoffrey rush  were both utterly useless  their parts were  limited  theyd  lucky  all    screen for more than  minutes  ben stiller too was wasted  mostly because  his unlikeable power and dialogue  none  these characters get  rise out  anybody  but happily they are lost  the charming flow  the film   far  the budget goes   was wisely spent  the cast  not the effects  while the set designs and action all look nice   glad there was  seperate aspect  that the film focused   and for that  applaud  slow  times  and rather pointless  mystery men still delivers   forgets about money making  because its not likely  make  bundle like its proceeders  and thats what works  stupid  maybe  but for once  not disappointed   one expected  intelligent film  but you get  film thats wit captures your attention and makes you forget this miserable year  \",\n          \"  were one  those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact  the success  failure  certain films   might say that  review movies that not look particularly good because  doing  service   readers  warning them against seeing    that were true   could put  banner  the top   site that reads   shay casey  seeing bad movies  you not have    but  know thats bunkyoure going  see whatever movies you want   matter what  say    have  tell the truth  every once   while  get  nasty  masochistic urge  see  bad movie  you know the feeling  when youre sick  seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want  see something you can have  ball trashing mercilessly  sometimes  think thats why anyone goes  see pauly shore movies  ever  admit   sometimes you like seeing bad movies        saw  supernova   truth  told   supernova  not quite  bad   thought  might   maybe  just felt sorry for the actors   maybe  thought  could have been decent  the studio not started tinkering with the directors  walter hill  final cut  causing him  want his name removed  maybe  becoming  softy   any case   not find  supernova   bad  the advance buzz would have  believe  but its still bad  the film takes place aboard the medical space vessel  nightingale   the crew includes captain     marley  robert forster   his new second officer nick vanzant  james spader   head medical officer kaela evers  angela bassett   medical technicians yerzy penalosa  lou diamond phillips  and danika lund  robin tunney   and computer technician benj sotomejor  wilson cruz   there are some attempts   characterization   but all that means  that nick has  shady past involving  drug addiction  which puts kaela  edge  yerzy and danika have  relationship that requires them  make kissyfaces  each other every five minutes  and benj  apparently gay    love with the computer  apparently female   not expect any more explanation  because you not get   anyway  the crew gets  distress call from  location deep  space  which  failed mining operation had been sent  during the dimension jump   think thats what its called  but not hold      the captain  killed and the man who sent the distress signal  peter facinelli   brought  board   calls himself troy larson  making him the supposed son   man kaela once had  relationship with  then  bunch  really predictable stuff starts happening  have you seen  alien   have you seen  event horizon    lame movie  its own right   good  then youve seen  supernova   postproduction cuts  not  there  nothing original about this screenplay  and nothing unpredictable either  after all   ones going  think for  second that troy not turn out    villain  but the bigger problem with  supernova   that  can  just stick  the simple plot its afforded  numerous rewrites  the script may  credited  three people  but its  gross underestimate  have crammed this lean minute film with tons  extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped  was there something about  limping robot shaped like  fighter pilot  did the ships computer learn something about humanity  what was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought  board with him  and just what does the films title signify   anything   far   can tell   refers   very small plot detail that not developed  just like the rest  these unnecessary story elements  character relationships  this film also make very little sense  for some reason  every person  this film keeps having sex   get  unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first  minutes  bassett and spaders characters start off hating each other  fifteen minutes and one bottle  pear brandy later  theyre engaging  some hankypanky  when troy the creepy stranger shows   the ship   course both female crew members will fall  love with him  every single shift  character interaction happens extremely suddenly  which  only one  the many obvious clues  how much this film has been cut  the most prominent example  however  may  the fact that when the film starts  there are  opening credits  furthermore  the end  the film looks like they took what were originally intended   the opening credits and spliced them  right before the real end credits  maybe thats why the films title  mentioned twice during the end credits  right between james spader and robert forster  right after you get over the shock  not being told what movie youre seeing  lest you decide  walk out upon making that discovery   you might notice that the movie seems  have dropped you right  the middle   scene  with littletono introduction  any  the characters  situations  the rest  the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff  the character changes  you know  where they explain things  and just went from point   point   point   danika  thoroughly enamored  yerzy and  ready  have his baby  point   tunney  now shagging troy and yerzy  unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing  not make sense  since  not understand anything about these characters motivations  did  care when troy abruptly starts murdering them onebyone  and  does  knocking off three  them  about  minutes   not  whit  its  shame  because this cast contains  lot  talented actors looking for something    they not find   bassett and spader say every line  the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions  their faces  sexual tension  more like constipation  maybe theyre just embarrassed  having  utter such howlers   this thing was made  someone more powerful than god and  whole lot less nice   not that  ever find out who that   mind you  the climax  their relationship  taking place   transport pod   probably the films biggest foreheadslapper   troy  peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain  history that  one ever suspected    awfully onenote  but its not   hes given any more notes  work with  the rest  the cast does even less  tunney stands around looking cute  then scared  phillips broods  cruz flirts with the computer  then they all die and  star blows   something  but  really not paying much attention  then   supernova   pretty awful  but  cutting   little slack merely because  expected less than what  got  thats    you expect    good  for whatever reasons you may have   youll probably hate  more than  will  even the special effects are fairly unimpressive  nothing you haven  seen before  and suffice  say the script not going  save the film  honestly  though  what  you expect from  film with about  dozen writers and  director who had his name removed and replaced with  pseudonym   usually results   bad movie  and thats what  supernova    \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":
